# Eth-Avax-frontend-integration

## The FUNCTIONALITIES added to the starter Project

1. Styling the whole content is centered on the page. Before, it was just horizontally now it is both vertically and horizontally centered.
2. Added the functionality of Depositing and Withdrawing the ETHs according to your desire i.e. you can change the amount of ETH you can transfer.
3. Previously, If you Withdrew more than the balance the page crashes and the error was shown from blockchain. Now, if you Withdraw more (handled on  the frontend) the transaction doesn't go through and an alert message is shown.
